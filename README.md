### Hello Github!

---

Currently developing software for a local startup while finishing my degree because I'm responsible like that.
I have a passion for automating unnecessarily boring daily tasks and programming in general. 
I also stare at my monitor and mesh keys for an assumingly unhealthy amount of time daily.
